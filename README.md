## Features
* The script only need the video ID of your chapter and that's all.
* You can choose the quality of your chapter before download them.
* The script download the subtitles too, in the language of your choose.
* Once the video download ends, you can choose to download the next chapter without re run the script.

## Requirements
* Any GNU/Linux distribution.
* PHP5-cli
* Enough disk space to hold your chapters :P
